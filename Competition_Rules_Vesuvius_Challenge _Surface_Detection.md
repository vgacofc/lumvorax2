Vesuvius Challenge - Surface Detection

Build a model to virtually unwrap ancient scrolls.
Overview

Some ancient scrolls are too fragile to open, but that doesn’t mean we can’t read them. Can your model help?

Before we can recover what’s written between the lines, we first need to find the lines. You’ll work with CT scans from the Villa dei Papiri to train a model that follows the scroll’s surface, one of the trickiest and most essential parts of virtually unwrapping the text.

Description

The library at the Villa dei Papiri is one-of-a-kind: it’s the only classical antiquity known to survive. But when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79, most of its scrolls were turned into carbonized bundles of ash. Nearly 2,000 years later, many are still sealed shut, too delicate to unroll and too complex to decode. In this competition, you’ll build a model to segment the scroll’s surface in CT scans, a critical step in revealing the texts hidden inside.

Physical unrolling would destroy the scrolls, and today’s digital methods can handle only the easy parts, like clean, well-spaced layers. But the tightest, most tangled areas are often where the real discoveries hide. To recover those, we need better segmentation to handle noise and compression without distorting the scroll's shape.

You’ll work with real 3D CT data from the previous Vesuvius Challenge, which uncovered passages from sealed scrolls, including an ancient book title revealed for the first time. Your model’s job is to trace the scroll’s surface as it winds through folds, gaps, and distortions so the next stage of virtual unwrapping can do its magic.

Your efforts could help unlock works of philosophy, poetry, and history that haven’t been read in centuries. Texts that might have been lost forever—until now.

Let’s bring them back, one layer at a time.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes 3D chunks of binary labeled CT scans of the closed and carbonized Herculaneum scrolls. Data was acquired at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, on beamline BM18 and at the DLS synchrotron in Oxford, on beamline I12.

The dimension of a sample chunk is not fixed, and can vary across the dataset.

Image showing the software used to virtually unwrap the scrolls

A papyrus sheet is composed of two layers, the recto and the verso, one with horizontal fibers and one with vertical fibers on top of each other.

The ideal solution is detecting the recto surface – the surface of the papyrus sheet that faces the umbilicus (the center of the scroll). The recto surface lies on the layer composed of horizontal fibers. Since the scrolls survived a carbonized eruption, the sheets can be partially damaged and frayed. Detecting, within a reasonable approximation, just the position of a sheet, no matter whether the segmentation surface encompasses both the recto and the verso, is also fine for the purpose of virtually unwrapping the scrolls.

Avoid topological mistakes: artificial mergers between different sheets and holes that split a single entity in several disconnected components.

The output of the machine learning model can be directly used in the Vesuvius Challenge pipeline to digitally unwrap (and read) the Herculaneum scrolls. Curious? Have a look at the latest tutorial on their digital unwrapping pipeline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHbpVcGD06U

Because the host team is laser-focused on unwrapping these scrolls, their research will continue throughout the Kaggle competition. Their annotation team will semi-manually unwrap additional portions of papyrus, and they expect to release both more labeled data AND ancient text as the competition progresses. Unlike the original training set, which underwent careful proofreading and refinement, these new labels will be less curated. Please use your judgment to decide how (and whether) each additional chunk should be incorporated into model training.
Evaluation

This competition uses a weighted average of three different segmentation metrics: Surface Dice, TopoScore, and VOI. See this notebook for a working copy of the metric and this dataset for the implementation details of each sub-metric. For general advice on how to optimize your submissions for the metric, see the Metric Summary section below. Note that this metric takes a relatively long time to run; you may need to wait several hours for scoring to complete.
Submission File

You must submit a zip containing one .tif volume mask per test image. Each mask must be named [image_id].tif, match the dimensions of the source image exactly, and use the same data type as the train mask.

Metric Summary
How We Score: Topology‑Aware Metrics for 3D Surface Segmentation

We reward surface proximity (SurfaceDice@τ), instance consistency (VOI split/merge), and shape correctness (TopoScore) so good unwrapping is not only accurate but topologically right.
Why topology matters here

To virtually unwrap the Herculaneum scrolls we must find the ink‑bearing papyrus surface—and keep it as a single, clean sheet as it winds through the volume. Beyond voxel‑wise accuracy, we must avoid mergers across adjacent wraps and splits within the same wrap, and we must preserve high‑level surface traits (no spurious holes/handles). Classic region‑overlap metrics (e.g., Dice) can look great even when these topology errors are severe. That’s why the leaderboard blends surface similarity, instance‑level consistency, and topological correctness.
Leaderboard formula (higher is better)

We linearly combine three bounded scores in [0,1]:
Score = 0.30 × TopoScore + 0.35 × SurfaceDice@τ + 0.35 × VOI_score

Leaderboard ranking uses the average score over all test volumes.

• All terms are in [0, 1].
• The tolerance τ for Surface Dice is in the same physical units as the case spacing, and it’s set to τ=2.0.
• Weights are fixed for the competition unless announced otherwise.
1) SurfaceDice@τ — Are the two surfaces within tolerance?

A surface‑aware variant of Dice: it scores the fraction of surface points (both prediction and ground truth) that lie within a spatial tolerance τ of each other. This respects that both labels and predictions may be off by a voxel or two while still capturing the right geometry.

    Computation essentials: extract voxelized surfaces of prediction (P) and ground truth (G); compute nearest‑surface distances with case spacing; count matches when distance ≤ τ; average matches both ways (P↔G).
    Edge cases: both empty → 1.0; exactly one empty → 0.0.
    Defaults: τ = 2.0 (in spacing units) unless specified.

2) VOI_score — Do instances split/merge correctly?

Variation of Information (VOI) compares the connected‑component labelings of prediction and ground truth. It decomposes into VOI_split = H(GT | Pred) and VOI_merge = H(Pred | GT), which track over‑segmentation (splits) and under‑segmentation (merges), respectively. We convert the lower‑is‑better VOI_total = VOI_split + VOI_merge into a bounded score: VOI_score = 1 / (1 + 𝛂 VOI_total), with 𝛂 = 0.3.

    Computation essentials: run 3D connected components (default 26‑connectivity) on union foreground; compute VOI on these integer labelings; map to VOI_score as above.
    Interpretation: VOI responds strongly to component splits/merges and complements the shape‑level guarantees of TopoScore, described in the next section.

3) TopoScore — Are the topological features preserved?

Using Betti (number) matching from algebraic topology, we compare the topological features present in prediction vs. ground truth in each homology dimension k: k=0 (components), k=1 (tunnels/handles), k=2 (cavities). We compute a per‑dimension Topological‑F1 based on matched features, then take a weighted average over active dimensions.

    Default weights: w0=0.34, w1=0.33, w2=0.33; inactive dimensions (no features in both) are skipped with renormalization.
    Why this helps: detects bridges across neighboring wraps (extra k=1), within‑wrap breaks (extra k=0), and spurious cavities (extra k=2).

What each metric “sees” (cheat sheet)

SurfaceDice@τ focuses on boundary proximity; VOI captures instance split/merge behavior; TopoScore captures shape‑level topology.
See the table below for a quick mapping of common error patterns to metric responses.
Error pattern 	SurfaceDice@τ 	VOI_score (split/merge) 	TopoScore (Betti)
Slight boundary misplacement (≤ τ) 	Tolerant (often unchanged) 	Usually unaffected 	Unaffected
Artificial bridge between parallel layers 	Local effect – May stay high 	Merge ↓ (under-segmentation) 	k=0 / k=1 (components and tunnels) – penalized ↓
Split of the same wrap into pieces 	Local effect – May stay high 	Split ↓ (over-segmentation) 	k=0 components – penalized ↓
Spurious holes/handles in the sheet 	Local effect – May stay high 	Small or none 	k=1/k=2 – penalized ↓
Evaluation details & edge cases

    Binarization: foreground is non‑zero by default (or x > threshold if a threshold is specified).
    Ignore regions: voxels marked ignored (via GT label or explicit mask) are set to background in both prediction and GT before all computations.
    Connectivity (VOI only): default 26 in 3D.
    Spacing & tolerance: all distances use per‑case spacing (sz, sy, sx); τ is in the same physical units.
    Empty‑mask conventions: both empty → SurfaceDice=1, VOI_score=1, TopoScore=1; one empty → SurfaceDice=0; VOI_score near 0; TopoScore=0 on k=0.

Practical tips for competitors

    Favor continuity within a wrap; avoid bridges across wraps (thin spurious connections are costly in VOI and TopoScore).
    Mind connectivity: thinning/dilation can alter counts; check results under 26‑connectivity.

    Competition Use and Non-Commercial & Academic Research: You may access and use the Competition Data for non-commercial purposes only, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules. In any published abstract, you will cite “EduceLab-Scrolls” as the source of the data in the abstract. In any published manuscripts using data from EduceLab-Scrolls, you will reference the following paper: Parsons, S., Parker, C. S., Chapman, C., Hayashida, M., & Seales, W. B. (2023). EduceLab-Scrolls: Verifiable Recovery of Text from Herculaneum Papyri using X-ray CT. ArXiv [Cs.CV]. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.02084. You will include language similar to the following in the methods section of your manuscripts in order to accurately acknowledge the data source: “Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the EduceLab-Scrolls dataset [above citation].” For further information on the EduceLab license, please follow this link.

b. Data Security.

    You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.

5. WINNER LICENSE

a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

    Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

    For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.

    In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.
6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS

a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):

    Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.

    By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)

    Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.

7. ELIGIBILITY

a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.
8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS

a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

    Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. For Hackathons, the Submission deliverables will be as described on the Competition Website, which may be information or materials that are not software code.

a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”

b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,

    Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;

    Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

9. GOVERNING LAW

Dataset Description

Your challenge in this competition is to detect and segment layers of papyrus in 3D imagery. This will help researchers virtually unroll the ancient scrolls from Herculaneum and ultimately recover the original texts.

This competition uses a hidden test set. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data will be made available to your notebook. Expect to see roughly 120 volumes in the hidden test set.
Files

[train/test].csv Metadata for the imagery.

    id - A unique ID for the volume.
    scroll_id - A unique ID for the source scroll. The provided volumes only cover a relatively small fraction of each scroll.

[train/test]_images/ 3D tif imagery. Each image is a sub-volume from a larger scan. Note that the sole test image available for download is simply a copy of one of the train images. This is for illustrative purposes only.

train_labels/ Label masks encoded such that 0 = background, 1 = foreground, 2 = unlabeled. Most masks only cover a subset of the volume.
Additional Data

The Vesuvius Challenge team has made a great deal of additional data available on their site. Some of it may prove useful for unsupervised learning.
