**Total**: 26 skills (added `agent-teams`), each with SKILL.md (≤200 lines) and REFERENCE.md (variable length), all refactored for compliance and enhanced functionality

**Agent Teams Integration**: `agent-teams`, `parallel-subagents`, `execute-plan`, `review`, `close-plan`, `spec-driven-workflow`, `confirm-plan` now leverage Agent Teams coordination patterns

## Common Tasks

### Implement Features with Tests
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Coder (sonnet)
- **Usage**: `/02_execute` command
- **Cycle**: Red (write test) → Green (implement) → Refactor (improve)

### Iterate Until Quality Gates Pass
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/ralph-loop/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Coder (sonnet)
- **Usage**: After first code change in `/02_execute`
- **Max iterations**: 7

### Refactor Code for Quality
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/vibe-coding/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Coder (sonnet)
- **Limits**: Functions ≤50 lines, Files ≤200 lines, Nesting ≤3 levels

### Create Git Commit
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/git-master/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Coder (sonnet) or user
- **Usage**: `/03_close` command (when user requests commit)
- **Format**: Conventional commits with Co-Authored-By

### Create or Review Documentation
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/documentation-best-practices/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Documenter (haiku) or any agent
- **Standards**: CLAUDE.md (400+), Commands (150), SKILL.md (100), REFERENCE.md (300)

### Confirm Plan After Creation
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/confirm-plan/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Plan-Reviewer (sonnet)
- **Usage**: `/01_confirm` command
- **Workflow**: Extract plan → Create file → Auto-review → Interactive Recovery

### Execute Plan with TDD
- **Skill**: @.claude/skills/execute-plan/SKILL.md
- **Agent**: Coder (sonnet)
- **Usage**: `/02_execute` command
- **Workflow**: Detect plan → Analyze dependencies → Implement with TDD → E2E verification (Step 5) → Iterate

## Patterns

### Auto-Discovery Pattern
Skills are auto-discovered via frontmatter `description`:
```yaml
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {trigger-rich description for auto-discovery}
---
```

### File Pair Pattern
Each skill has two files:
- **SKILL.md** (≤200 lines): Quick start, core concepts, further reading
- **REFERENCE.md** (~300 lines): Detailed examples, patterns, external resources

### Skill-Workflow Integration
Skills are integrated into agent workflows via cross-references:
```markdown
> **Methodology**: @.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md
```

## Skill Categories

### Agent Teams Skills
- `agent-teams`: Agent Teams coordination patterns
- `parallel-subagents`: Rewritten for Agent Teams teammate spawn patterns

### Development Skills
- `tdd`: Test-Driven Development cycle (used by coder teammates)
- `vibe-coding`: Code quality standards

### Workflow Skills
- `ralph-loop`: Autonomous completion loop (used by coder teammates)
- `git-master`: Version control workflow

### Documentation Skills
- `documentation-best-practices`: Documentation standards

## Usage by Agents

### Coder Teammate (sonnet)
- `tdd`: Red-Green-Refactor cycle (within teammate context)
- `ralph-loop`: Iterate until quality gates pass (autonomous)
- `vibe-coding`: Refactor code for quality
- `git-master`: Create commits (when requested)

**Agent Teams**: Spawned by Team Lead in /02_execute, runs autonomously, messages team lead if blocked

### Documenter Teammate (haiku)
- `documentation-best-practices`: Create/review documentation

**Agent Teams**: Spawned by Team Lead in /03_close, syncs documentation with change detection

### Plan-Reviewer Teammate (sonnet)
- `documentation-best-practices`: Review plan documentation

**Agent Teams**: Spawned by Team Lead in /01_confirm, verifies requirements completeness

## Size Guidelines

**SKILL.md**: ≤200 lines
- Quick start (when to use)
- Core concepts (essential patterns)
- Further reading (links)

**REFERENCE.md**: ~300 lines
- Detailed examples
- Good/bad patterns
- External resources

## Frontmatter Verification

All skills require:
```yaml
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {trigger-rich description}
---
```
