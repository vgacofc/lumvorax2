    The resulting :class:`~.Samplex` built from a circuit with a box with this annotation has
    a tensor input with name ``basis_changes.ref`` and shape ``'(len(box_instruction.qubits),)'``.
    The tensor is indexed in physical qubit order, in other words, the order of the qubits in the
    outer-most circuit, restricted to those used by the box.

    Args:
        decomposition: How to decompose basis changing gates.
        dressing: Which side of the box to attach the dressing instructions.
        mode: Whether to add gates to prepare or measure in a given basis.
        ref: A unique identifier of this basis change. If ``None``, it is set to ``mode.value``.
