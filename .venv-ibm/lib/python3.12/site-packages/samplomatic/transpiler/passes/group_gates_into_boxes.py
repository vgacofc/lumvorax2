    """Collect the two-qubit gates in a circuit inside left-dressed boxes.

    This pass collects all 2-qubit gates in the input circuit into left-dressed boxes. To assign the
    gates to these boxes, it uses a greedy collection strategy that tries to collect gates in the
    earliest possible box that they can fit.

    .. note::
        Barriers and boxes that are present in the input circuit act as delimiters. This means that
        when the pass encounters one of these delimiters acting on a subset of qubits, it
        immediately terminates the collection for those qubits and flushes the collected gates into
        a left-dressed box. The delimiters themselves remain present in the output circuit, but are
        placed outside of any boxes.

    .. note::
        Measurements also act as delimiters.

    .. note::
        The circuits returned by this pass may not be buildable. To make them buildable, one can
        either use :class:`~.AddTerminalRightDressedBoxes` to add right-dressed "collector" boxes.
