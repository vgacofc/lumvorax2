    To group instructions into boxes, a pass manager returned by this function takes the following
    steps in order:

    * If ``remove_barriers`` is ``True``, it removes all the barriers in the input circuit
      using the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveBarriers` pass.
    * If ``enable_gates`` is ``True``, using the :class:`~.GroupGatesIntoBoxes` pass,
      it creates boxes containing two-qubit gates. The resulting boxes are twirl-annotated and
      left-dressed, and contain a single layer of two-qubit gates.
    * If ``enable_measures`` is ``True``, it uses the :class:`~.GroupMeasIntoBoxes`
      pass to group the measurements. All the resulting boxes are left dressed. Depending
      on the value of ``measure_annotations``, they own a :class:`~.Twirl` annotation, a
      :class:`~.ChangeBasis` annotation, or both.
    * It adds idling qubits to the boxes following the given ``twirling_strategy``.
    * Using the :class:`~.AddTerminalRightDressedBoxes` pass, it adds empty right-dressed boxes
      to ensure that the resulting pass manager can produce circuits that can be successfully
      turned into a template/samplex pair by the :meth:`samplomatic.build` function.
    * It uses the :class:`~.AbsorbSingleQubitGates` pass to absorb any chains of single-qubit gates
      in the circuit into a box, left- or right-dressed, that immediately succeeds the chain. This
      will cause the gates to be folded into the dressing once the circuit is built.
    * If ``inject_noise_targets`` is not ``'none'``, it uses the
      :class:`~.AddInjectNoise` pass to replace boxes with new boxes that additionally have
      inject noise :class:`~.InjectNoise` annotations.
    * If ``add_tags`` is not ``'none'``, it uses the :class:`~.AddTags` pass to add a
      :class:`~.Tag` annotation to every box.

    Args:
        enable_gates: Whether to collect single- and multi-qubit gates into boxes using the
            :class:`~.GroupGatesIntoBoxes` pass.
        enable_measures: Whether to collect measurements into boxes using the
            :class:`~.GroupMeasIntoBoxes` pass.
        measure_annotations: The annotations placed on the measurement boxes by
            :class:`~.GroupMeasIntoBoxes` when ``enable_measures`` is ``True``. The supported values
            are:

            * ``'twirl'`` for a :class:`~.Twirl` annotation.
            * ``'change_basis'`` for a :class:`~.ChangeBasis` annotation with mode
              ``measure``.
            * ``'all'`` for both :class:`~.Twirl` and :class:`~.ChangeBasis` annotations.

        twirling_strategy: The strategy for whether and how twirling boxes are extended to
            include eligible idle qubits; the boxing pass manager begins by constructing twirling
            boxes that contain one layer of multi-qubit gates or measurements, preceded by all of
            the adjacent single-qubit gates, then, according to the value of this option, these
            boxes are extended to include idling qubits. The allowed values are:

            * ``'active'``: No idling qubits are added to the boxes, meaning that every box only
              twirls the qubits that are active within the box.
            * ``'active_accum'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls all
              qubits that have been acted on by some instruction in the circuit up to and including
              the box.
            * ``'active_circuit'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls all
              qubits acted on by any instruction in the circuit.
            * ``'all'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls all of the
              qubits in the circuit.

        twirling_group: The group to use for the twirling boxes.

            * ``'pauli'`` uses the Pauli group.
            * ``'balanced_pauli'`` uses the Pauli group with a balanced distribution.
            * ``'local_c1'`` uses the subgroup of single-qubit Cliffords that are conjugated to
              single-qubit Cliffords on any entangling gates in the box, and the Pauli group
              everywhere else.

        decomposition: The gate sequence into which single-qubit dressing gates are synthesized.

            * ``'rzsx'`` synthesizes single-qubit gates with rz-sx-rz-sx-rz.
            * ``'rzrx'`` synthesizes single-qubit gates with rz-rx-rz.

        inject_noise_targets: The boxes to annotate with an :class:`~.InjectNoise` annotation
            using the :class:`~.AddInjectNoise` pass. The supported values are:

            * ``'none'`` to avoid annotating boxes of any kind.
            * ``'gates'`` to annotate all the twirled boxes that contain entanglers, such as
              those created by the :class:`~.GroupGatesIntoBoxes` pass, and avoid annotating
              all the other boxes.
            * ``'measures'`` to annotate all the twirled boxes that own a classical register,
              such as those created by the :class:`~.GroupMeasIntoBoxes` pass, and avoid
              annotating all the other boxes.
            * ``'all'`` to target all the twirl-annotated boxes that contain entanglers
              and/or own classical registers.

        inject_noise_strategy: The noise injection strategies supported by the
            :class:`~AddInjectNoise` pass. The following options are supported. In all these
            options, by "equivalent boxes" we mean boxes that are equal up to single-qubit
            gates on the dressing side.

            * ``'no_modification'``: All the equivalent boxes are assigned an inject noise
              annotation with the same ``ref`` and with ``modifier_ref=''``.
            * ``'uniform_modification'``: All the equivalent boxes are assigned an inject noise
              annotation with the same ``ref`` and with ``modifier_ref=ref``.
            * ``'individual_modification'``: All the equivalent boxes are assigned an inject noise
              annotation with the same ``ref``. Every box is assigned a unique ``modifier_ref``.

        inject_noise_site: The noise injection sites supported by the :class:`~AddInjectNoise` pass.
            All possible string values are:

            * ``'before'`` to inject noise before the hard content of the box.
            * ``'after'`` to inject noise after the content of the box.

        remove_barriers: When to apply the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveBarriers` pass.
            All possible string values are:

            * ``'after_stratification'`` removes barriers, but only after entangler and
              measurement instructions have been boxed and extended with ``twirling_strategy``, and
              before single-qubit gates are boxed. This effectively allows barriers to be used as
              hints to choose the entangler and measurement content of boxes, while also letting
              single-qubit gates move freely past where there had been a barrier, allowing them be
              absorbed into adjacent boxes.
            * ``'immediately'`` removes barriers before doing anything else, so that existing
              barriers effectively have no role in box grouping.
            * ``'finally'`` removes barriers, but only as the very last step. This causes, for
              example, single-qubit gates that are trapped between barriers to not be placed
              into boxes.
            * ``'never'`` causes barriers to never be removed.

            Boolean values are deprecated such that ``True`` corresponds to ``'immediately'`` and
            ``False`` corresponds to ``'never'``.

        add_tags: Whether and how to add a :class:`~.Tag` annotation to every box using the
            :class:`~.AddTags` pass. Boxes with pre-existing :class:`~.Tag` annotations are left
            unchanged. The supported values are:

            * ``'none'`` to not add any tags.
            * ``'unique_box'``: the ``ref`` is a truncated hash of the box's structural content
              (i.e. ignoring single-qubit gate, and see :class:`~.BoxKey`), so structurally
              equivalent boxes share the same ``ref`` across circuits. Boxes with different
              :class:`~.Twirl` specifications are treated as unique, but all other annotations are
              ignored when comparing boxes.
            * ``'unique_instance'``: the ``ref`` is an incrementing counter (``t0``, ``t1``, ...),
              so every box in a circuit gets a unique ``ref``. The counter resets on each call to
              :meth:`run`.
            * ``'noise_ref'``: the ``ref`` is taken from the box's :class:`~.InjectNoise`
              annotation's ``ref`` field joined by an underscore with its ``modifier_ref`` field
              when present. Boxes without an :class:`~.InjectNoise` annotation are
              skipped.``'noise_ref'``: the ``ref`` is taken from the box's :class:`~.InjectNoise`
              annotation's ``ref`` field. Boxes without an :class:`~.InjectNoise` annotation are
              skipped (no :class:`~.Tag` is added). Typically used together with a non-``'none'``
              ``inject_noise_targets`` value.

    Returns:
        A pass manager that groups operations into boxes.

    Raises:
        TranspilerError: If the user selects a combination of inputs that is not supported.
