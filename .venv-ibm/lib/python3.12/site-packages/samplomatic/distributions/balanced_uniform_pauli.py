class BalancedUniformPauli(Distribution):
    r"""The balanced uniform distribution over virtual Pauli gates.

    Here, *balanced* means that on every qubit, each of the four Paulis appears the same number of
    times, provided that the requested number of samples is a multiple of four. Moreover, when the
    number of samples is a multiple of two, it is promised that, for each qubit, X or Y is
    sampled the same number of times as I or Z.

    The sampling algorithm is simply to draw four times fewer n-qubit Paulis uniformly and iid than
    requested, and then replicate each four times with respective multiplications by
    :math:`I^{\otimes}n`, :math:`X^{\otimes}n`, :math:`Z^{\otimes}n`, and :math:`Y^{\otimes}n`,
    truncating the samples if their requested number is not a multiple of four. Randomizations are
    ordered such that the four replications are consecutive. The particular ordering of the
    four multiplicative terms--- :math:`I` then :math:`X` then :math:`Z` then :math:`Y` ---is what
    provides the guarantee that for each qubit, X or Y is sampled the same number of times as I or
    Z, even if the number of samples is even but not a multiple of four.

    Args:
        num_subsystems: The number of subsystems this distribution samples.
